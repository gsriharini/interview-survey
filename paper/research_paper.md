# AI-ML Based Interview Process Optimization: Enhancing Recruitment Efficiency and Candidate Experience

## Abstract
This research addresses the challenges in technical interview processes, particularly focusing on the inefficiencies faced by both candidates and companies during mass recruitment. We propose an AI-ML based solution to streamline the technical assessment and interview process. Through a comprehensive survey of job candidates and company representatives, we identify key pain points and requirements for an automated system. Our proposed solution includes automated technical assessment, intelligent candidate ranking, and optimized interview scheduling, potentially reducing time-to-hire while maintaining assessment quality.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The technical interview process, especially during mass recruitment, presents significant challenges for both employers and candidates. Companies struggle with efficiently evaluating large numbers of candidates, while applicants face issues with multiple rounds of similar technical assessments and lengthy waiting times.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current technical interview processes are:
- Time-consuming for both parties
- Resource-intensive for companies
- Often redundant across different companies
- Potentially biased and inconsistent
- Logistically challenging for mass recruitment

### 1.3 Research Objectives
1. Identify key challenges in current technical interview processes
2. Analyze the feasibility of AI-ML solutions in interview optimization
3. Propose an automated system for initial technical assessment
4. Evaluate potential impact on recruitment efficiency

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Current Interview Practices
- Traditional technical interview methods
- Existing automated assessment tools
- Current challenges in mass recruitment

### 2.2 AI in Recruitment
- Current applications of AI in hiring
- Machine learning for candidate assessment
- Automated technical evaluation systems

### 2.3 Research Gap
- Limited solutions for mass technical interviews
- Need for standardized technical assessment
- Lack of integrated AI-ML systems in recruitment

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Survey Design
